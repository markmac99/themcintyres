<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Solve the Rubik's Cube
</h1>
<hr>
This page, and the two that it links to, are copies of the pages to be found at <a href=http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm> this page on the net </a>. 
<hr>

<p><em>So you have a Rubik's Cube, and you've played with it and stared
at it and taken it apart...need I go on any further? The following are
two complete, fool-proof solutions to solving the cube from absolutely <strong>any</strong> legal position. Credit goes not to me, but to David Singmaster, who wrote a book in 1980, </em>Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube<em>,
which explains pretty much all of what you need to know, plus more.
Singmaster wrote about all of these moves except the move for Step 2,
which I discovered independently (along with many other people, no
doubt).</em></p>

<p><em>I've updated this page to include a second solution to the cube. I learned this solution from the </em>Handbook of Cubik Math<em>
by Alexander H. Frey, Jr. and David Singmaster. I would strongly
recommend getting this book; there are all sorts of interesting
problems and exercises to do. This solution is a bit more free-form
than the first solution, as there are less moves to memorize. However,
it probably requires a little more intuition about cubing on your part
to be able to use it effectively. I'm not really sure which of the two
solutions would be better to learn first. I prefer the second method,
because it is definitely simpler.</em></p>

<p><em>I should point out that these are both beginner-level solutions.
They are easy to learn (in particular Solution #2). If you want to be
able to solve the cube in 20 seconds, this is not the page for you:
check out the speed cubing links later on in the page. The faster
solutions generally require considerably more memorization and
practice. If this is your first time solving the cube, I think you've
come to the right place.</em></p> 

<p><em>I have a couple of "cheat sheets" (<a href="rubiks1.htm">Solution #1</a>, <a href="rubiks2.htm">Solution #2</a>),
which are one page documents, suitable for printing, that contain the
moves. These are not suitable for learning with, rather they can be
used as a quick reminder while you are trying to memorize the moves.
They should print on one page in most browsers at normal text settings.
If they don't fit, just reduce the size of the text in the browser and
try again. These are new as of December 2003 so I am soliciting
feedback (rubiks [at] jeays [dot] net)</em></p>

<h2><a name="sol1">Solution #1</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sol1step0">Step 0 -- Notation</a></h3>

<p> Before we get started, we must work out a method for describing the
various moves that will be made. There are six faces, with the
following notations: </p>

<ul>
<li>Upper, or top face = U</li>
<li>Down, or bottom face = D</li>
<li>Left face = L</li>
<li>Right face = R</li>
<li>Front face = F</li>
<li>Back face = B</li>
</ul>

<p> We can turn each face either clockwise or counter-clockwise, with
respect to the center (i.e. a move that may be clockwise to you, when
looking at the cube, may not be clockwise for that face, in relation to
the middle of the cube). The names for the different kind of moves
(I'll use the U face as an example) are:</p>

<ul>

<li>A 90-degree turn clockwise on a face, is denoted by U.</li>

<li>A 90-degree turn counter-clockwise on a face is denoted by U' ("U prime") (Also note this is the same as U, done three times).</li>

<li>A 180-degree turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise on a face, is denoted by U<sup>2</sup> ("U squared") and is the same as two clockwise turns, or two counter-clockwise turns.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can refer to individual pieces by a two-letter (for edges) or
three-letter (for corners) combination. For example, the piece in the
upper right front corner is called URF, and the edge piece to the down
and left of the cube is called DL. Also, these notations refer to the
piece that is in that place at that time, <b>not</b> the piece that should go there.</p>

<p>Also, note that during any sequence of moves the position of the center pieces with respect to one another is unchanged.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step1">Step 1 -- Do the first face</a></h3>

<p><em>I was thinking of omitting this step; if you've come so far as
to seek help for doing the Rubik's cube, then you've probably been able
to do one side. But I've included the details in for completeness.</em></p>

<p>The first step involves choosing a color, and getting all the pieces
of that color to form a complete face. These must also be in the
correct relative location.</p>

<p>First, we will do the edges. Let's say we pick white as the side to
complete first (many people choose white as it is the easiest color to
pick out). Turn the cube so that the white center piece is on the U
face. Note that the centers are attached, so that they are always in
the same position with respect to one another, unlike a cube of even
degree (i.e. 2 x 2 x 2 or 4 x 4 x 4).</p>

<p>First, we put the edge pieces (those with 2 colors) in the right
place. There are several possibilities. Note that when moving pieces
around you should have the piece that you are working on the F face.</p>

<ul>

<li>White/Other color (OC) piece is on the D face. Rotate the D face so
that it is directly underneath the place where it needs to go (on the U
face). If the white side of the piece is on the D face, apply F<sup>2</sup>, and it will be correct. If the white side of the piece is not on the D face, apply D R F' R'.</li>

<li>White/OC piece is on the center slice (i.e. middle portion of the
cube) . Apply F or F' to get the piece on the D face, and then perform
above moves.</li>

<li>White/OC piece is in correct position, but incorrectly rotated. Apply F<sup>2</sup> and do the above moves as necessary.</li>

</ul>

<p> Second, we do the corners. There are six main possibilities for each of the four corner pieces: </p>

<ul>

<li>Corner piece in correct place. Do nothing.</li>

<li>Corner piece is in the correct place, but incorrectly rotated, so
that the piece needs rotating clockwise. Hold the cube so that this
piece is in the URF location, and apply F D F' D' F D F'.</li>

<li>Corner piece is in the correct place, but incorrectly rotated, so
that the piece needs rotating counter-clockwise. Hold the cube so that
this piece is in the URF location, and apply R' D' R D R' D' R.</li>

<li>Corner piece on D face. Rotate D face so that the corner piece you
want to move into position is directly underneath its intended
location. If the corner piece has white (or whatever color you chose)
on the bottom, and the destination of the piece is URF (i.e. the upper
right hand corner on the front of the cube), apply R' D<sup>2</sup> R D R' D' R.</li>

<li>Corner piece on D face, and white side of the corner is on the left
hand side, assuming that the piece is going to the URF location. Apply
F D F'.</li>

<li>Corner piece on D face, and white side of the corner is on the
right hand side, assuming that the piece is going to the URF location.
Apply R' D' R.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>You should be finished the white face by now. This step is fairly intuitive, so it shouldn't have been too much of a problem.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step2">Step 2 -- Do the middle layer edge pieces</a></h3>

<p><em>Okay, so the U face is done...Now we have to get the edge pieces
of the middle layer in place, that is the FR, FL, BR, BL pieces.</em></p><p>

</p><p>There are four possibilities:</p>

<ul>

<li>Edge piece is in the correct place and oriented correctly -- do nothing.</li>

<li>Edge piece is in correct place, but oriented incorrectly. In this
case, you have to replace it with another piece temporarily. Choose an
edge piece that is on the D face, and move it to the position of the
aforementioned edge piece using the move described in the following
list item.</li>

<li>Edge piece is in an incorrect place in the middle layer. In most
cases, you can just skip this edge piece for now, as it will move to
the D face when you put the correct edge piece in that place. If you
have two edge pieces in the middle layer that are in each other's
correct places, then you will need to break the cycle by replacing one
of those edge pieces with one of the D face edge pieces.</li>

<li>Edge piece is on the D face. This is good. Let's say you want to
move the yellow-red edge piece into place on the middle layer. (Your
cube may not have yellow and red as adjacent pieces, so you may have to
substitute different colors). Check which side of the yellow-red piece
is actually on the D face. Say yellow is on the D face. Rotate the D
face so that the yellow-red piece is opposite from the yellow center.
(If the yellow center is on the F face, then the yellow-red piece is
the DB piece, got it?). Now, hold the cube so that white is the U face,
and the yellow center is on the F face. Which side of the yellow-red
piece is the red face on? If the red center is on the L face, then
apply F' D' F D L D L'. If the red center is on the R face, then apply
F D F' D' R' D' R. One way to think about this move, if you're trying
to memorize it, is that you are removing the corner piece on the U side
right above the edge piece you're trying to replace, and then putting
it back in from the other direction, with the side effect of moving the
edge piece into the correct place.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>This will have to be repeated at least 4 times in order to get all of the 4 middle layer edge pieces into place.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step3">Step 3 -- Form cross on last layer</a></h3>

<p><em>The first two layers should now be completely correct. From now
on, turn the cube upside-down, so that the first face (white, in my
example) is the D face. It will remain this way until the cube is
complete. The reason for this is just to make the manipulations a bit
easier to perform.</em></p>

<p><em>On my cube, green is opposite to white, so I will refer to the
green face as being the new U face for our purposes. We must now try to
form a green cross, out of the green center, and the four edge pieces
that surround it.</em></p>

<p>There are 4 possibilities:</p>

<ul>

<li>All four pieces are correct, and you have green cross on the U face. Do nothing.</li>

<li>Two adjacent edge pieces are correct. For example, the UF and UR
piece have green on the top, forming a sort of L shape, with the
center. The UL and UB pieces do not have green on the top. In this
situation, hold the cube so that the UF and UR pieces have green on the
top (as in the example earlier in this paragraph), and apply B U L U'
L' B'.</li>

<li>Two opposite edge pieces are correct, and the other two aren't.
Let's say UR and UL are correct (this should make a green line down the
middle of the U face). Apply B L U L' U' B'.</li>

<li>No edge pieces have green on the top. Hold the cube any way (still
keeping the green center on the top) and apply B L U L' U' B' F U R U'
R' F' (for those of you who want to memorize the moves, you should
realize that this is the same as doing the move in the third part of
this section, then rotating the cube 180 degrees, and then applying the
move in the second part of this section).</li>

</ul>

<p><em>You should now have the bottom two layers all correct, as
before, and a green cross (or whatever the color on your cube whose
center is opposite to white is) on the top face.</em></p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: If the bottom two faces are perfectly correct,
and you have 1 or 3 edge pieces that show green on the top, then your
cube is messed up. Somebody (maybe you!) took it apart (or changed the
stickers around) at some point in time. Might as well take it all apart
right now, reassemble it correctly and start again.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step4">Step 4 -- Rotate U face edge pieces</a></h3>

<p><em>You now have a green cross on the U face, but...these edge
pieces may not be in the correct order. This step involves rotating
them so that the can be lined up with their respective colors.</em></p>

<ul>

<li>If all 4 pieces are correct (the entire cube is correct except for four corner pieces on the top layer), then do nothing.</li>

<li>If 1 piece is correct, then rotate the whole cube so that this
piece is in the UL position (make sure green is still on the top). If
the remaining 3 edge pieces need to be rotated clockwise, apply R<sup>2</sup> D' U<sup>2</sup> R' L F<sup>2</sup> R L' D R<sup>2</sup>. If the pieces need to be rotated counter-clockwise, apply R<sup>2</sup> D' R' L F<sup>2</sup> R L' U<sup>2</sup> D R<sup>2</sup>.</li>

<li>If 2 "adjacent" edge pieces (by "adjacent" here I mean pairs such
as UF and UL, or UB and UL, and not UF and UB, or UR and UL), then
rotate the U face so that only 1 edge piece is correct, and follow that
rule.</li>

<li>If 2 opposite (i.e. not adjacent!) edge pieces are correct, then apply U or U' and follow the rule for 0 edge pieces correct.</li>

<li>If 0 edge pieces are correct, turn the U face so that: for the UF
piece (which can be any piece), the F side of that piece is the same
color as the R face center. Now apply R<sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> B<sup>2</sup> D L<sup>2</sup> F<sup>2</sup> L<sup>2</sup> F<sup>2</sup> L<sup>2</sup> F<sup>2</sup> D' B<sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> R<sup>2</sup>.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>The four U face edge pieces should now be in the correct place.
The cube should be all correct now except for the four corner pieces on
the U face.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step5">Step 5 -- Position U face corner pieces</a></h3>

<p><em>Now we must move the corner pieces into the right places.</em></p>

<p>There are 3 possibilities:</p>

<ul>

<li>All 4 corner pieces are in the right place, although not necessarily rotated correctly. Do nothing.</li>

<li>1 corner piece is in the right place. Hold the cube so that it is
in the UFR position. If the remaining three corner pieces need to be
rotated clockwise, apply L' U R U' L U R' U'. If they need to be
rotated counter-clockwise, apply U R U' L' U R' U' L.</li>

<li>0 corner pieces are in the right place. If they all need to go to opposite corners, apply R' B<sup>2</sup> F R F' R' F R F' R' F R F' R' B<sup>2</sup>
R. If they need to go to adjacent corners, hold the cube so that UFR
and UFL pieces need swapping, and so do the UBR and UBL pieces. Apply B
L U L' U' L U L' U' L U L' U' B'.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Okay, now all of the corner pieces should be in the right place. We're almost there!</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol1step6">Step 6 -- Rotate corner pieces</a></h3>

<p>Hold the cube so that an incorrectly rotated corner piece is in the
UFR position. If it needs to be rotated clockwise, apply F D F' D' F D
F' D'. If it needs to be rotated counter-clockwise, apply D F D' F' D F
D' F'. Now (and this is <em>extremely</em> important) turn the U face
only, so that the next incorrectly rotated corner piece is in the UFR
position. Apply one of the above moves, depending on which way it needs
rotating. Repeat if more than two corner pieces are incorrectly
rotated. After all pieces are rotated, simply turn the U face and
complete the cube.</p>

<p> This step may be confusing, simply because after just one corner
piece is rotated the cube is in quite serious disarray. Just make
certain that you move only the U face and it should work out fine. I'll
give one example to show exactly what will happen, for a simple
example: the UFR piece needs rotating clockwise, and the UBR piece
needs rotating counter-clockwise. Do these moves and the cube will be
complete F D F' D' F D F' D' U D F D' F' D F D' F' U'.</p>

<p> Note that there are only certain combinations of incorrectly
rotated pieces. If your cube gets to a position where there is a
situation other than one of these, then it has probably been taken
apart by small green aliens, so I would recommend disassembling it and
starting over.</p>

<ul>

<li>One piece needs rotating clockwise, one piece needs rotating counter-clockwise, other two are correct.</li>

<li>Three pieces all need rotating clockwise, other one is correct.</li>

<li>Three pieces all need rotating counter-clockwise, other one is correct.</li>

<li>Two pieces need rotating clockwise, two pieces need rotating counter-clockwise.</li>

<li>I was going to write "all corner pieces are correct" here, but I guess that would be obvious.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="sol2">Solution #2</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sol2step0">Background for Solution #2</a></h3>

<p><em>If you are not familiar with the standard notation, please check <a href="#sol1step0">Step 0 -- Notation</a>
from Solution #1. The following solution is a much easier to memorize
way of solving the cube. Most of the moves are easy to understand, such
that you don't even feel that you are memorizing anything. I will try
to explain what to <strong>think</strong> when you are solving the
cube. This section is new as of early December 1997, so I would really
appreciate any feedback on this section in particular.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step1">Step 1 -- U face edge pieces</a></h3>

<p>So your cube is scrambled right now. The first thing to do is to
chose a color, say white (it tends to stand out from the other colors
on the cube). It's also a very good idea to always to a specific color
first, since you will begin to learn which colors are adjacent, which
speeds up things considerably.</p>

<p>The first step is to form a cross on the top face of the cube.
Orient the cube so that the white center piece is on top. You want to
get the correct pieces in the UL, UB, UR and UF locations. So, you will
need to done some of the following moves: (be sure to do those in the
first step first.</p>

<ul>

<li>If a white-other color (OC) piece is on the U face:

<ul>

<li>If white is in the U position, simply rotate the U face until the OC is lined up with its center.

</li><li>If OC is in the U position, rotate the U face so that the
piece is at an adjacent edge location to its desired location. Hold
your cube so that white is the U center and OC is the F center. Now
rotate U so that the white-OC piece is in the UR position. Now apply R'
F'.
</li></ul>

</li>

<li>If a white-OC piece is in the middle slice of the cube (the middle
third), then hold the cube so that white is still on the U face, but
this white-OC piece is in the FR location. Now, you should notice that
you will be able to move it to the U face by applying F' (if the white
face on the R side) or R (if the white face is on the F side). Find the
spot where that white-OC piece should go. Rotate U until you can apply
either F' or R to move the white-OC piece in the correct spot, so that
the white face will move to the top. Examples: You want to move the
piece in FR, with white being the R face, to its home location at UL,
so apply U' F' U. You want to move FR, with white being the F face, to
its home location at UL, so apply U<sup>2</sup> R U<sup>2</sup>. See
how you simply move U, then bring the edge piece up to the U face, then
move U back to restore the original position, plus the piece you just
moved.</li>

<li>If a white-OC piece is on the bottom slice of the cube:

<ul>

<li>If the white is on the D face, simply rotate D until the OC is directly underneath its center, and apply F<sup>2</sup> (assuming the piece is at the FD position) to put it in the correct location.</li>

<li>If the OC is on the D face, hold the cube so white is the U center,
and OC is the F center. Rotate D so that the white-OC piece is in the
RD position, and apply R F' R' (you do not need R' if the UR piece had
not been placed correctly yet).</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>You should now have a white cross formed on the top of your cube.
Also you should be developing an intuition about these moves. What you
will learn to do after a few times through this, is just think how the
edge pieces are located <em>relative</em> to one another. This should speed things up.</p><p>

</p><hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step2">Step 2 -- U face corner pieces</a></h3>

<p>The second step is to correctly position <strong>three</strong> of
the U face corner pieces. The reason that you will only put three of
them and not four into place is that this method uses a "working space"
which greatly simplifies the later steps.</p>

<p>There are three basic possibilities for putting corner pieces into place: </p>

<ul>

<li>The piece is on the D slice, with the white side <em>not</em> on
the D side. In this case, rotate the D face so that it is directly
underneath the location that it should go to. Now, hold the cube so
that the piece is in the DRF spot, and the intended location is the UFR
spot.
<ul>

<li>If white is on the R side of the corner piece in DRF, apply R' D' R.

</li><li>If white is on the F side of the corner piece in DRF, apply F D F'.

</li></ul>

</li>

<li>The corner piece is on the D slice, but the white face is on the D
side. Rotate the D face so that the corner piece is in the DRF spot,
and the intended location is the URF spot. Now apply R' D<sup>2</sup> R D R' D' R. Note that you are doing R' D<sup>2</sup>
R to move the white side off the bottom of the cube, so that you can
use one of the moves in the previous section. Also note that equivalent
to this is: F D<sup>2</sup> F' D' F D F'. I would imagine if you are
left-handed this would make things easier. Speaking of which, if you
are left-handed, I would be interested if you naturally use a
particular one of these processes. Personally I am right-handed and do
the "R' D<sup>2</sup> R..." move, without really thinking about it.</li>

<li>The corner piece in question is in the right spot but incorrectly
rotated. Therefore, we must rotate it. Hold the cube so that it is in
the URF location. Now,
<ul>

<li>If the white side is on the R face, apply R' D' R D R' D' R.

</li><li>If the white side is on the F face, apply F D F' D' F D F'.

</li></ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><em>So now you should be done one side, except for one corner piece.
This location will be used to swap corner pieces in and out, greatly
simplifying later processes. The moves in the first two steps are
really quite intuitive. After only a few repetitions, you should find
them simple and natural to do.</em></p><p>

</p><hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step3">Step 3 -- Middle edge pieces</a></h3>

<p>This step involves correctly placing three of the four edge pieces
on the "middle" layer of the cube. For these moves you will need to
hold your cube so that the white face is on the bottom. The only middle
layer edge piece that you do not position is the one right above the
corner piece that you did not position correctly in step 2.</p>

<p>First of all, make sure the white side is on the bottom, and the
"empty" (i.e. incorrect) corner piece on the white side is in the DRF
location. The middle layer edge pieces will all be positioned in this
step, except for the FR one.</p><p>

</p><p>To move a piece into position, rotate the cube about its
vertical axis, so that the intended location is the FR location. (For
example, you want to put the FL piece in place. Rotate the cube a
quarter turn counter-clockwise). Now rotate the bottom slice so that
the incorrect corner piece is in the DRF location. (So in the previous
example -- for the FL piece -- you would first turn the cube, then
apply D').</p>

<p>Now you are ready to do the move. The move to put the new edge piece
into place can only be done if it is on the U slice. If it is, note
which side is NOT on the U face. You will need to apply either F' or R,
depending on the orientation of the edge piece you want to move. Then,
apply U until the piece you want to move is in the UF or UR (depending
on your previous move) location, and then F or R', to get it back to
normal. I'd better give an example... Yellow is the F center. Orange is
the R center. You wish to position the Yellow-Orange edge piece, to the
FR position. You have already rotated the D face so that the DRF
location does not contain a white corner piece. You see the
Yellow-Orange piece in the UB location. You note that Orange is the U
side, and Yellow is the B side. Thus, you apply F' U<sup>2</sup> F. All that description for three easy moves :-).</p>

<p>To continue, simply keep rotating D or D' and moving the cube to set
up the same position, with an "empty" corner in DRF, the intended
location at RF, and the piece you want to move in the U slice. Note
that in some cases the piece may already be in the correct location,
but orientated incorrectly. In this case you will have to take it out
first (i.e. put any edge piece with the color whose center is opposite
white on your cube into that location) and then put it back in that
spot. In other words, with the DRF corner "empty" and the offending
piece in the FR spot, apply F' U' F U R U' R'.</p>

<p><em>Now you should be done 2/3 of the cube, less two pieces: a
middle layer edge piece and its adjacent corner piece, that appears to
take a chunk out of the bottom (white) layer. Note that it is possible
for the "empty" corner piece on the bottom layer to get solved by
accident. If so, just ignore it, and pretend that it is unsolved.</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step4">Step 4 -- Solve remaining edge pieces</a></h3>

<p>This is the only step that requires any actual memorization. I think
you'll find that the moves from the other steps become very natural
after a short time. There are two basic parts to this step, as follows.
The goal of the whole step is to solve all of the 5 remaining edge
pieces. The first part is to solve three of these (UF, UL, UB), and the
second part is to solve the other two together.</p>

<p>First of all, hold the cube so that the "empty" edge piece is in the
BR position, and thus the "empty" corner piece is in the RDB position.
To do moves in this part, you first of all move a piece into the BR
location, then move it to the U face, to one of those UF, UL, or UB
positions. The move is as follows. First, optionally rotate U. Then,
apply R' or B. Then rotate U the desired amount. Then do R or B' (to
undo the first part of this move). Pretty simple huh?! An example may
be in order. Let's say the Blue-Yellow piece is in the BR location.
Furthermore, Blue is the U color, and Yellow is the L color. You would
thus apply U [to put the UL location (the destination) in the right
spot] B U' B'. However, when actually trying to solve the cube quickly,
before applying U' in the previous move, you should look to find the
next edge piece that you wish to put in the right location. So rotate U
until it is in the UB location, and then by applying B' you return the
cube to a stable position. Then, you will need to rotate U some amount
to get the UL piece (Blue-Yellow in the example) back to the right
place. There is a tremendous amount of freedom in this sequence of
moves. In fact, you do not need to return the edge pieces to the
correct spots in between repetitions of this move. Simply realize how
the pieces go with respect to one another, and then finally align them,
when all three (UF, UL, UB) are done.</p>

<p>Now, there are four possibilities. The remaining edge pieces are the BR piece and the UR piece. Do the following:

</p><ul>

<li>Luckily, the pieces are correct. Move to the next step and smile at your good fortune.</li>

<li>The pieces are in the correct locations, but incorrectly oriented. Apply B U' B' U R' U R U'.</li>

<li>Both edge pieces (BR and UR) have the same color on the R side of
the piece, which is the same color as the R center. Apply U' R' U' R U'
R' U' R U'.</li>

<li>The other case (the UR piece has the R color on its U side, and B
color on its R side, and the BR piece has the U color on its R side,
and the R color on its B side). Apply B U B' U B U B' U<sup>2</sup>.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>If you want to reduce memorization at the expense of some speed,
two of these moves suffice. In other words, if you apply all three of
these moves in any sequence to an all-edges correct cube, you will get
back an all-edges correct cube.</em></p><p>

</p><hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step5">Step 5 -- Position corner pieces</a></h3>

<p>In this step you want to move the remaining unsolved corner pieces
to their correct locations, irrespective of orientation. Hold the cube
so that the "empty" corner piece on the bottom (white) face is in the
DRB location. Rotate the U face so that the piece that you want to
position is in the UFL location. Apply L D<sup>2</sup> L'. Now, rotate
the U face so that the location (with respect to the top-layer edge
pieces) of the corner piece you are working on is in the UFL location.
Now apply L D<sup>2</sup> L' again. Rotate U so that everything lines
up. Repeat this (up to 3 times) until all of the corner pieces are in
the right location.</p>

<p>This step is a little confusing at first. First of all, make sure
your DRB piece is that "empty" (unsolved...not missing :-) ) corner
piece. Say the UFL piece is Blue-Yellow-Orange. But that piece should
go in the URB location. You would do the following moves: L D<sup>2</sup> L' [move the piece in question out of the way (to the DRB location, if you're interested)] U' [move the correct <b>location</b> to the UFL spot] L D<sup>2</sup>
L' [move the piece question back to the U slice] U [undo the U twist
you did earlier]. One thing to note when doing this move, make sure the
original UFL piece does not contain the color of the bottom face (white
in my ongoing example). Also note that you are free to rotate the U
face before the move so that you can move a particular corner piece
that you want to position into the UFL location so that you can work
with it. The only (slight) difference will be that you will need to
rotate U at the end to make up for that. Note that these U-rotations
should be very obvious. You can simply line up the top-layer edge
pieces with their respective centers.</p>

<p>The remaining paragraphs in this section are optional, and a bit
more advanced and lengthy, so you may want to skip over them if this is
your first time through. If you want to add a bit of speed to this
solution and perhaps save some work during Step 6, read on. There are
two ways of optimizing this step. First, you can position two of the
corner pieces at once (instead of one, as I describe above), and
second, you can often rotate some of the pieces appropriately while you
are positioning them.</p>

<p>If you consider a plane of symmetry running through the four corners
(yes, only three are actually needed) UFL, UBR, DFL, DBR, you will
notice that L D<sup>2</sup> L' (the move I introduced at the start of this section) and F' D<sup>2</sup>
F are mirror images. This means it's possible to do either one (the
same move must be done twice, you can't mix and match) in order to
complete this section. If you know how the pieces are going to rotate,
then you can take advantage of this in order to do some orienting of
the pieces while you position them.</p>

<p>I usually approach this section by first looking at the DBR piece.
This allows you to position two pieces at once, since you don't just
choose an arbitrary corner on the U face, you specifically rotate U so
that when you start the move, you will send the DBR piece to the proper
location. There are three possibilities for how it is rotated.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the U color is on the R face of the DBR piece, then doing the F' D<sup>2</sup>
F move will correctly rotate it. So in this case, you would first of
all position the U face so that the UFL position was where the DBR
piece should go, then do F' D<sup>2</sup> F, then rotate U so to piece you just moved out of the UFL position will get moved into the correct place, and then do F' D<sup>2</sup> F again.</li>
<li>If the U color is on the B face of the DBR piece, then doing the L D<sup>2</sup> L' move will correctly rotate it. Follow the same procedure as for the previous condition.</li>
<li>If the U color is on the D face of the DBR piece, then you can't
correctly rotate it with one of the moves. However, you can still
correctly position two corner pieces, if the place that you are sending
the DBR piece to is not occupied by a corner piece containing white,
the D color.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the DRB piece is already in the correct place, you can often save
a rotation by choosing to correctly position a U face corner piece that
has the U color on its U face. Both the F' D<sup>2</sup> F move or L D<sup>2</sup> L' move will rotate it correctly.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="sol2step6">Step 6 -- Orient corner pieces correctly</a></h3>

<p>Corner pieces must be rotated in pairs -- one clockwise and one
counter-clockwise. Find two incorrectly rotated corner pieces that are
on the same slice. Hold the cube so that one of the pieces in the UFL
position and the other is somewhere on the U slice.</p>

<ul>

<li>To rotate a piece clockwise, apply L D<sup>2</sup> L' F' D<sup>2</sup> F.</li>

<li>To rotate a piece counter-clockwise, apply F' D<sup>2</sup> F L D<sup>2</sup> L'.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that after orienting the first corner piece, apply U until the
other corner piece goes in the UFL location. You will then need to turn
U to undo the previous twisting (this should be fairly obvious). Here's
an explicit example -- the UFL piece needs rotating counter-clockwise,
and the UFR piece needs rotating clockwise. The full sequence would be
as follows: F' D<sup>2</sup> F L D<sup>2</sup> L' [orient UFL piece] U [position other corner] L D<sup>2</sup> L' F' D<sup>2</sup> F [orient original UFR piece] U' [undoes rotation of U that was done earlier].</p>

<p>You may need to apply this pattern up to 3 times. Note that you can
only do one clockwise and one counter-clockwise twist. You cannot twist
three corner pieces all clockwise, like the corner-twisting move in
Solution #1. If the two remaining corner pieces are diametrically
opposed (e.g. at UFL and DRB), then you can apply R<sup>2</sup> (in this case) to bring both of them onto the U slice. Then, do the sequence. The apply R<sup>2</sup> again to get to the original configuration.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<h3><a name="disassembly">How do I disassemble / assemble my cube?</a></h3>

<p>So you want/need to take your cube apart. Turn a face 45 degrees. Obtain a fairly flat key or screwdriver. <strong>Gently</strong> lift the edge piece in the middle of the rotated face with your thumb, while <strong>gently</strong> inserting the screwdriver. <strong>Slowly</strong> prise the piece out. Do <strong>not</strong>
force it. After one piece is out the rest come out fairly easily. You
might want to take a good look at the mechanism that holds the cube
together; it's quite interesting. If you were unclear before about how
the centers always have the same relative position, it should be very
clear now. </p>

<p>Time to put the cube back together? Assemble the first two layers
correctly. This isn't too bad. Then for the top layer, first turn the
center piece 45 degrees, then insert one edge piece, then the two
surrounding corner pieces, then the adjacent edge pieces, so that one
row is left without pieces. Then place the two corner pieces in their
positions. For the final edge piece, hold it at about a 45 degree
angle, and push it <strong>gently</strong> down into place.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="explanation">Why must the cube be reassembled correctly?</a></h3>

<p> Note that you must reassemble the cube so that it is solved
correctly. If you reassemble the pieces haphazardly, there is but a 1
in 12 chance that your cube will be solvable. Wondering why? The
following is not a rigorous proof but rather an explanation of what is
happening. There are 12 edge pieces, and eight corner pieces in a cube.
These move about separately, that is to say, an edge piece could never
swap places with a corner piece. It's possible to move all but one of
the edge pieces to any location, with either orientation. The last edge
piece is forced to take on a particular orientation. You can see this
for yourself by simply removing one edge piece and turning it around.
If you now try to solve the cube, you will find that it is impossible.
However, if you remove another (any other!) edge piece and flip this
one too, and try to solve this cube, you will find that it is possible.
Thus, there are two equally likely possibilities for the edge pieces
when the cube is assembled randomly: edge pieces have been flipped from
their true positions an even number of times, in which case the cube is
solvable; or an odd number of times, in which case it's not.</p>

<p>Onto the corner pieces. Each corner piece has three possible
orientations: correct, rotated clockwise, and rotated
counter-clockwise. Of the 8 corner pieces, they must have a total
number of rotations that is divisible by three evenly. You can test
this for yourself by twisting one corner piece, and trying to solve the
cube. You'll find that it's impossible. If you twist another random
piece the opposite way, these will cancel each other out and the cube
will be solvable, however if it gets twisted the same way, the cube
will still be unsolvable. You'll need a third twist in the same
direction to return the cube to a solvable position. So, if all the
corner pieces are in place, there are three equally likely situations
to occur. Finally, we must look at the actual positions of the corner
pieces, without regard to rotation. Notice how during step 5, it is
never the case that only two corner pieces are out of position? Well,
that is one of the unsolvable positions. The "first" six corner pieces
can go anywhere. This leaves two corner pieces, for two corner spots.
One of these positions is solvable, and one of them isn't.</p>

<p> The three events above are all independent, so applying a little
probability, we can see that there are 2 x 3 x 2 = 12 "orbits" or
groups of positions that cannot be reached from one another. Only one
of these leads to the solved Rubik's Cube.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="order">How many (legal) positions does the cube have?</a></h3>

<p>The naive way to approach this problem is as follows: there are 12
edge pieces, and 8 corner pieces. First of all, note that (obviously) a
corner piece could never go in the spot of an edge piece. Edge pieces
and corner pieces can be arranged in 12! * 8! ways, according to basic
counting laws. Now, each of the edge pieces can have one of two
orientations, and each of the corner pieces can have one of three
orientations. So we must multiply the previous number (counting the
different locations of pieces), by 2<sup>12</sup> * 3<sup>8</sup>, representing the total number of positions. This number is 519,024,039,293,878,272,000 (~= 5.19 * 10<sup>20</sup>).
However, this is not the correct answer, due to physical constraints of
the cube. Not all of these positions are possible, as outlined in the
previous section. We are able to rotate all but one of the corner
pieces in any way, but the final corner piece is determined by the
first seven. So we must divide our final answer by 3 (i.e. the number
of orientations we originally gave to the final corner piece) to
account for this. The same argument holds for the edge pieces, so we
must also divide by 2. Finally, we cannot swap two edge pieces or two
corner pieces. If you decide to take apart your cube, and simply swap
two edge pieces, you will find the cube unsolvable. What will happen is
that you can solve the edge pieces, but then two corner pieces will be
swapped, and this situation cannot be fixed. So, we divide the total
number again by 2 (i.e. we divide the above number by 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 --
"from" the previous section). This result, the "order" of the cube
"group", is: 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (~= 4.32 * 10<sup>19</sup>). I
like to give a physical representation to big numbers, so here goes: if
you had a cube for every legal position, then you could cover the
entire surface of the earth (including oceans :-) ) about 250 times. A
chain consisting of all the cube positions would stretch about 250
(coincidentally!) light years. Feel free to invent your own
comparisons. Also, "order" and "group" have specific mathematical
definitions which, alas, I still don't understand.</p><p>

<h3><a name="records">What are some records related to solving the Rubik's Cube?</a></h3>

<p>The 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships was won by Dan Knights, of
the United States of America, with an average time of 20.00 seconds for
solving five cubes. The lowest record time for a solving a single cube
at in an official competition is 16.53 seconds, set by Jess Bonde, of
Denmark at the same event. In unofficial competition, or in practice,
there are a number of people who have recorded faster times than these
(see the <a href="#speedlinks">Speed Cubing</a> links below).</p>

<p>The original, oft-quoted world record that has been in the Guinness
Book of World Records, is 22.95 seconds, set by Minh Thai, of Vietnam,
in the original Rubik's Cube World Championship held in 1982.</p>

<p>Several people have informed me that they can or know people that
can solve the cube with only one initial look (perhaps several minutes
long). In other words, they study the cube, and then solve it,
blindfolded. One of these people is the aforementioned Dan Knights, who
says it takes 10 to 20 minutes of study. Clearly, this can't be beaten
(other than by psychics or by guessing, which we'll discount for now).
He has a <a href="http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/%7Eknights/CubeInfo.html">web page</a> explaining his technique, which is well worth a look.</p>

<h3><a name="purchase">Where do I purchase a Rubik's Cube?</a></h3>

<p>Finding a Rubik's Cube for sale can be a challenge, depending on
where you live. If you live in North America, your best bet is to visit
the nearest Toys R Us. They claim to keep Rubik's Cubes in stock all
the time, however this is not a sure thing. The cubes are not of the
greatest quality, however -- the stickers tend to get discolored and
come off, and the cubes do not turn that smoothly. On the plus side,
they are cheap and easy to obtain. Your next best bet is probably to
call up all the hobby/game/puzzle type stores in your area; you might
get lucky. If you wish to do speed cubing, you will probably have to
search for a particular type of cube. Tom Dennenbroek has <a href="http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/makinga.htm">some recommendations on obtaining a cube suitable for speed cubing</a>.</p>

<p>I bought an imitation Rubik's Cube from the "It Store" at Rideau
center in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (my hometown). The mechanism is a
little stiff and the colors are glittery and non-standard (silver
opposite gold, pink opposite red and blue opposite green). The
manufacturer is <a href="http://www.funworks.com/">Funworks</a> and
the Hologram Rubik's Cube cost is C$7.99. I wouldn't particularly
recommend this brand but it would do in a pinch. As of August 2002
their site seems to have several annoying Javascript errors so it may
be hard to find what you want.</p>

<p>I have been informed that Dollarama in Toronto sells imitation
Rubik's Cubes for C$1.00. It's unlikely that the quality is very good
but the price is certainly right. Another Toronto location with Rubik's
Cubes is Toys Toys Toys in the Eaton Center. The cost is C$19.99 and it
comes with a book. I have also been told that Cracker Barrel in the USA
sells imitation Rubik's Cubes (called "Magic Cubes") for $4.99 US. The
mechanism is a little stiff but solid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mefferts-puzzles.com/">Mefferts Puzzles</a> appears to sell regular cubes as well as Rubik's Revenges, Professor's Cubes (5 x 5 x 5) and many other similar puzzles online.</p>

<p>If you're willing to buy online, you can buy from <a href="http://www.rubikshop.com/">Hessport's Rubik Shop</a>. These seem a little expensive and the stickers wear off fairly easily, however it is probably a reliable source.</p>

<p>And finally, your best bet these days for purchasing hard-to-get items seems to be <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing. I hate disclaimers, but I obviously cannot guarantee the reliability of any of the cube sources mentioned here.</p>

<h3><a name="other">What are some games I can play with the cube?</a></h3>

<p> An interesting game for two people is to get a correct cube, and
for one person to secretly make a number of moves (try 4 to start
with), and then the other person has to undo those moves. I've been
able to do 7, maybe about 25% of the time. I can do 6 about 75% of the
time, and 5 or less virtually always. </p>

<p>There are numerous patterns that can be made with a correct cube.
Perhaps the two simplest are the "checkerboard" pattern, and the "dots"
pattern, which are achieved by applying the following moves to a solved
cube. For the checkerboard, do: R<sup>2</sup> L<sup>2</sup> U<sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> F<sup>2</sup> B<sup>2</sup>. For the dots pattern, do: R L' F B' U D' R L'. There are hundreds of other patterns to try -- <a href="http://web.idirect.com/%7Ecubeman/">The Domain of the Cube</a> has a huge collection.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="center">How do I orient the center pieces?</a></h3>

<p>Some promotional or novelty cubes contain patterns on the stickers.
Using the method above you can solve all of the cube as normal, except
you may end up with the center pieces incorrectly oriented. If this is
the case you can use a one or more of these three processes to
correctly orient them.</p>

<ul>

<h3><a name="unsolvable">How do I tell if the cube is unsolvable from a given state?</a></h3>

<p>As mentioned above, if you disassemble the cube and reassemble it
randomly, it is most likely that it will be impossible to solve. Try to
solve the cube as normal. All of the first few steps should work. When
you get down to the final stage for edge pieces or corner pieces, and
you notice one of the following oddities, you will need to disassemble
the cube and reassemble it properly:</p>

<ul>
<li>One edge piece is flipped in place and all other edge pieces are correct.</li>
<li>Two corner pieces need to be swapped and all other corner pieces are correct.</li>
<li>One corner piece needs rotating and all other corner pieces are correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are simplest cases. For the corner rotating one, if you count
a correct piece as 0, a piece that needs rotating clockwise as -1 and a
piece that needs rotating counter-clockwise as -1, then the sum of all
corner pieces must be divisible by 3. Similar arguments can be
established for the other two conditions.</p>

<h2><a name="misc">Miscellaneous</a></h2>

<h3><a name="myrecords">Personal Records</a></h3>

<p>My best time for solving the Rubik's Cube is 40 seconds, set on
February 21, 1998, using Solution #2. My record with Solution #1 is 57
seconds. I also keep a record for solving 5 straight cubes. My record,
set on February 13, 1998 is 286 seconds (average of 57.2 seconds per
cube).</p>

<p>On February 1, 1996 I managed to do the cube in only 6 "looks". I
haven't really tried to break this record since then, it is too taxing
on the mind and I don't have a photographic memory or anything like
that. Here's where I took my "looks": one at the start, then I solved
the edge pieces on the first face; one look to solve the corner pieces
of that first face; two looks for the middle edge pieces; one look for
Step 3 and one look for the last three steps (note that they Step 4 is
totally independent from Steps 5 and 6, and it's possible to look ahead
and see which corner pieces will need to be rotated in which
directions).</p>

<h3><a name="history">Page History</a></h3>

<p>A short note about the history of this page. The previous locations of this page were <code>http://qlink.queensu.ca/~4mj2/rubiks.html</code> (original) and <code>http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~ad161/rubiks.html</code>. I hope that this current URL, <code>http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm</code>
will be this page's permanent home. I created the page in November 1995
during a period of renewed interest in the cube for me. I did have a
counter on my home page at that time, which was getting around 5 hits
per day. I assumed that the traffic on the cube page would be a subset
of that. I was extremely surprised when I put a hit counter on the page
in October 1997 to see that it was getting around 50 hits per day. This
page underwent a major overhaul in December 1997 when I added the
second solution. By the time that my university account expired in
April 1999, the page was receiving around 120 hits per day.</p>

<p>As of August 2002, this page, and its previous revisions have
received somewhere on the order of 250,000 hits, about 120,000 of them
on <code>http://jeays.net</code>. If someone told me that the page
would get 1000 hits the night, in late 1995, after I wrote the initial
version (probably while procrastinating over doing my homework), I
don't think I would have believed them. Thanks for coming, and I hope
you'll continue to use the page and recommend it to your friends that
are interested in the cube.</p>

Moves, Record Times You'd Like to Share With Someone Who Might Care,
Criticisms, Observations of Errors in the Text and Flames can all be
directed to <code>rubiks [at] jeays [dot] net</code>, and I'll be
happy to answer these. If you are down to the last few pieces and your
cube is in a position for which there does not appear to be an
appropriate move, you might want to check the <a href="#unsolvable">list of unsolvable positions</a>. Please note that I do not have any solutions to any other puzzles (other than the partial solution to the <a href="http://jeays.net/rr.htm">Rubik's Revenge</a>).</p>

<p>One more thing, I guess it's too bad that there isn't a "URL" piece...oh, forget it!</p>
