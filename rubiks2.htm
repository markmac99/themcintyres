<h1>Rubik's Cube Cheat Sheet (Solution #2)</h1>

<p>This is a single page suitable for printing which contains the moves
alone. It's meant as a reminder, not a full solution. For a full
solution, see <a href="Rubik_Cube_solution.htm">How to Solve the Rubik's Cube</a>.
Notation: U = Up, D = Down, F = Front, B = Back, L = Left, R = Right.
CW = Clockwise, CCW = Counter-clockwise. X = Turn side X 90° CW, X' =
Turn side X 90° CCW, X<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> = Turn side X 180°.
"Rotate" means to re-orient a piece, keeping its location. "Swap" means
for two or more pieces to exchange places. "Move" means to change the
location of one piece while disregarding what goes in its original
location.</p>

<h2>Step 1 -- U face edge pieces</h2>

<p>Solve the four U face edge pieces.</p>

<h2>Step 2 -- U face corner pieces</h2>

<p>Solve three of the U face corner pieces.</p>

<h2>Step 3 -- Middle edge pieces</h2>

<p>Turn the cube upside-down and solve the UF, UL and UB pieces by swapping the BR piece with the appropriate edge piece.</p>

<h2>Step 4 -- Solve remaining edge pieces</h2>

<ul>
<li>B U' B' U R' U R U' (Rotate both UR and BR)</li>
<li>U' R' U' R U' R' U' R U' (Swap UR and BR)</li>
<li>B U B' U B U B' U<sup>2</sup> (Swap and rotate UR and BR)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5 -- Position corner pieces</h2>

<p>This move swaps the UFL, DBR, and one other corner piece. These
moves do the same thing but rotate the corner pieces in a different
direction.</p>

<ul>
<li>[U movement] F' D<sup>2</sup> F [U movement] F' D<sup>2</sup> F [U movement]</li>
<li>[U movement] L D<sup>2</sup> L' [U movement] L D<sup>2</sup> L' [U movement]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6 -- Orient corner pieces correctly</h2>

<p>This move rotates the UFL piece. Move must be done in pairs: one CW and one CCW rotation, operating at the same location.</p>

<ul>
<li>L D<sup>2</sup> L' F' D<sup>2</sup> F (Rotate piece CW)</li>
<li>F' D<sup>2</sup> F L D<sup>2</sup> L' (Rotate piece CCW)</li>
</ul>
